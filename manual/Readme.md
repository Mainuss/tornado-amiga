Preface

Welcome to the exciting world of Amiga demo making!

When I decided to release the source code of our framework it was pretty clear to me that its usefulness would be very limited if I didn't document it properly.

I've tried to do my best to present this in a way that is approachable and not overwhelming. There's a learning curve and quite a lot of material to cover, so please take your time. I can guarantee you it will pay off.
